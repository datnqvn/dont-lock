# dont-lock
You are sitting right in front of your computer, and thinking about a solution. 
But the stupid computer with a stupid policy doesn't know about it!
When you found an idea, your screen is locked and you have to type your strong password multiple times, in the worst case, you forget the idea before the computer lets you log in :(
